AppScale is an open-source cloud computing platform that automatically deploys and scales unmodified Google App Engine applications over public and private cloud systems and on-premise clusters. AppScale is modeled on the App Engine APIs and has support for Python, Go, PHP and Java applications.

AppScale is developed and maintained by AppScale Systems, Inc., based in Santa Barbara, California, one of the most beautiful places in the world.


## Why Use AppScale?
The goal of AppScale is to provide developers with a rapid, API-driven development platform that can run applications on any cloud infrastructure. AppScale decouples application logic from its service ecosystem to give developers and cloud administrators control over application deployment, data storage, resource use, backup, and migration.

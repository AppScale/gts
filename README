AppScale is a platform that allows users to deploy and host their own Google 
App Engine applications. It executes automatically over Amazon EC2 and 
Eucalyptus as well as Xen and KVM. It has been developed and is maintained 
by the RACELab at UC Santa Barbara. It supports the Python, Java, and Go
Google App Engine platforms.

The latest stable release is AppScale 1.6-rc1, released May 16, 2012. Feature
requests and pull requests gladly considered.

Why Develop AppScale?

Our goal with AppScale is to provide a open-source cloud platform that anyone 
can use to deploy your Google App Engines to and to perform research on cloud 
platforms. 

How can I help?

Unit tests help us a lot, so if you'd like to write unit tests for us, we would
appreciate it a lot! We're using flexmock/rcov for mocking and code coverage
information, so Rubyistas should dive in to the AppController, Neptune, or
InfrastructureManager folders and see what could benefit from unit tests there.
Alternatively, adding rdoc to those same projects to get us closer to 100%
documentation would also be great!

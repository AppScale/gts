# EXTRA_CLASSPATH provides the means to extend Cassandra's classpath with
# additional libraries.  It is formatted as a colon-delimited list of
# class directories and/or jar files.  For example, to enable the
# JMX-to-web bridge install libmx4j-java and uncomment the following.
#EXTRA_CLASSPATH="/usr/share/java/mx4j-tools.jar"

# enable this start also start Hadoop's JobTracker and/or TaskTrackers on this
# machine.  If left disabled, this will act as a regular Cassandra node.
HADOOP_ENABLED=1

# enable this to set the replication factor for CFS.  Note that this will only
# have an effect the first time a cluster is started with HADOOP_ENABLED=1 and
# after that will be a no-op. Defaults to 1.
#CFS_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1

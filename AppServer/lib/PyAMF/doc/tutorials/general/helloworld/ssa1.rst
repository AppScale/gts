What is Server-side ActionScript
================================

Server-side |ActionScript (TM)| is based on the ECMA-262 specification
(ECMAScript 1.5), which is derived from JavaScript and lets you access
the core JavaScript server object model.

Client-side |ActionScript (TM)| is based on the ECMA-262 specification
but deviates from the specification in several places. Server-side
|ActionScript (TM)| does not deviate from the ECMA-262 specification.

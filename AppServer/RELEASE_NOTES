App Engine SDK - Release Notes

Version 1.8.1

Python
===============================
- The Task Queue async API is now a GA feature. The asynchronous methods
  improve utilization by allowing your app to add, lease and delete multiple
  tasks in parallel.
- Cloud Console projects are now created by default whenever a new App Engine
  app is created.  This is a Preview feature.
- In an upcoming release the Experimental Google Cloud Storage API Functions
  will be decommissioned. This API and its Experimental status is documented at
  the following link:
  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/googlestorage/functions
- The Google Cloud Storage library will replace Google Cloud Storage API and is
  now available as a Preview feature.  More information can be found at
  https://code.google.com/p/appengine-gcs-client/
- Bandwidth between App Engine and Google Cloud Storage is currently free of
  charge (this may change in the future for certain levels of service).
- The Search API has graduated from Experimental to Preview. Apps that have
  billing enabled can exceed the free quota levels and will be charged for
  usage above these levels.
- Estimated number of search results will only be accurate if it is less than
  or equal to the number of results requested. By default this can be
  overridden by setting number_found_accuracy QueryOption in the Search API.
- Dates, atoms, and number fields can now be found by searching without a field
  restriction in the Search API.
- A quoted empty string now returns atom fields with empty values for the
  Search API.
- Snippet and count functions are no longer allowed in sort expressions for the
  Search API.
- The Search API now has improved error messages for user errors and internal
  errors.
- App Engine now supports deployment of applications via the Git tool. Once you
  complete the initial setup steps, you will be ready to deploy apps with the
  same ease you push code to a git repository using
  "% git push appengine master". This is a Limited Preview feature. You may
  request access via the following link:
  https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/forms/d/
  1aLaAOZb_cXFiVqzLAMvPV9kh0FmvlLRUbwD-LBbLuUI/viewform
- The Datastore now assigns scattered auto ids by default. Legacy auto ids
  are still available via the 'auto_id_policy' option in app.yaml.
- The Sockets API now allows client code to call get/set options against
  sockets. Previously, calls raised "Not Implemented" exceptions. For supported
  options, calls to getsockopt will return a mock value and calls to setsockopt
  will be silently ignored.  Errors will continue to be raised for unsupported
  options. The currently supported options are: SO_KEEPALIVE, SO_DEBUG,
  TCP_NODELAY, SO_LINGER, SO_OOBINLINE, SO_SNDBUF, SO_RCVBUF, and SO_REUSEADDR.
- Updated skip_files documentation to reflect the new default.
  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/
  appconfig#Skipping_Files

- The application summary no longer displays the default version of a running
  application, instead it lists the application as 'RUNNING'. In an upcoming
  release applications will have multiple logical sub components, each of which
  will have a default version. This UI update is meant to align with this
  functionality.
- Projection queries are now a fully supported GA feature.
- The XMPP API now has multi-JID get_presence. This provides the ability to get

  SortExpression.RANK_FIELD_NAME (i.e. _order_id) field in ascending order has
  been removed.
- Globally consistent indexes in the experimental Search API are now deprecated
  and will be removed in the next release.
- Task Queue tasks may now be added and deleted asynchronously. This allows

  --persist_logs flag is still needed in order for logs to be saved.
- The deprecated classes and functions AddError, AddResult,
  ListIndexesResponse, ListResponse, RemoveError, RemoveResult, and
  list_indexes were removed from the Search API in the SDK.  If your app
  references any of these classes or functions, you must deploy a new version
  without these references before the next release of App Engine. If you do not
  do this, your app may stop working in production.
- The Conversion API, which was decommissioned last release, has been removed
  from the SDK.  In a future release, the API will be removed from the runtime

- A note about an upcoming change: starting with the 1.7.3 release
  of App Engine, data statistics will report statistics on property type
  usage by indexes using the documented property type names ("Integer",
  "Key", etc, see
  https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/stats)
  rather than the current property representation names ("INT64",
  "REFERENCE", etc, see http://goo.gl/db5dT). This will affect the
  __Stat_PropertyType__, __Stat_PropertyType_Kind__,
  __Stat_PropertyType_PropertyName_Kind__ and their per-namespace equivalents.
  This will also affect the displayed "Breakdown by Property Type" under the
  "Datastore Statistics" in your application's console.

- On November 7th, App Engine will be out of Preview. The new Terms of Service
  and previously announced pricing changes will be in effect. Additionally, all
  paid apps are now covered by our SLA.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/billing.html
- Paid apps can now specify the maximum pending latency for instances and the
  minimum number of idle instances for your application in the Admin Console.
- Task Queue storage has been separated in to its own line item. Previously,
  this was included in Datastore storage.
- We have released an experimental utility, available in the Admin Console, to
  assist in migrating your application to the High Replication datastore. This
  utility allows you to copy the bulk of your data in the background, while the
  source application is still serving. You then need a brief read-only period to
  migrate your application data while you copy the data that has changed from
  the time the original copy started.
- Blobstore, which was previously limited to apps with billing enabled, is now
  available for all apps.
- We have published a new article on Datastore Index Selection and Advanced
  Search which explains our recent improvements to the query planner that make
  exploding indexes unnecessary.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/indexselection.html
- Applications can now receive xmpp error stanzas at /_ah/xmpp/error.
- In the Admin Console data viewer, you can now filter by namespace from a drop
  down menu, if applicable.
- In the Admin Console's Datastore Statistics, we now offer namespace suggest
  for filtering stats.
- We have released as experimental the full MapReduce framework.
- The SDK now supports Python 2.7.
- Python 2.7 now supports WebOb 1.1.1, which has some significant bug fixes.
  Applications that explicitly set the "webob" version to "1.1" in their
  app.yaml files must update the version to "1.1.1".
- The mail_stub.get_sent_messages() call now returns EmailMessage instances.
- Fixed an issue when setting an initial_value in memcache.incr unexpectedly
  returned a string.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2012
- Fixed an issue where DoS stats in the Admin Console didn't work for High
  Replication apps.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5237
- WARNING: Starting with 1.6.1 (our next release, NOT this release), URLFetch
  requests will honor the Accept-Encoding header. If your code sets this header
  then it must be prepared to receive content of the specified type. For more
  information please see
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=4978

Version 1.5.5
===============================
- Python 2.7 is now available as an experimental runtime for all applications
  using the High Replication Datastore. To upload your app to the Python 2.7
  runtime, change the runtime argument in your app.yaml to python27. Note that
  the dev_appserver does NOT work with Python 2.7 - you must deploy your
  application in order test it.
- We have increased the number of files you can upload with your application
  from 3,000 to 10,000.
- We have increased the size limit for a single file uploaded to App Engine from
  10MB to 32MB.
- We have increased the Frontend request deadline from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.
- We have increased the online URLFetch maximum deadline from 10 seconds to 60
  seconds. The default deadline remains at 10 seconds. The offline maximum deadline
  for URLFetch remains at 10 minutes.
- We have increased the URLFetch Post payload from 1MB to 5MB.
- App Engine now supports Cross Group (XG) transactions with the High
  Replication Datastore, which allow you to perform transactions across
  multiple entity groups.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/transactions.html
- We have released an experimental API that can write to Google Storage for
  Developers directly from App Engine.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/googlestorage/overview.html
- We have added a graph to the admin console that displays the number of
  instances for which you will be billed.
- In the XMPP API, get_presence() is deprecated in favor of using the inbound
  presence handlers documented in
  http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/xmpp/overview.html#Handling_User_Presence.
- The Task Queue API 'target' parameter now accepts a new value,
  taskqueue.DEFAULT_APP_VERSION, which will send the task to the default
  frontend version, rather than the version or backend where the 'add' method is
  being called.
- In the URLFetch API, make_fetch_call() now returns an RPC object.
- Fixed an issue in the Admin Console where the "Run Now" button did not work
  for tasks with a '-' in the name.
- Fixed an issue where the SDK did not decode Base64 encoded blobs.
- Fixed an issue to provide a better error message when using the Mail API to
  send email to an invalid user address.
- Fixed an issue in the SDK where a skip_files entry caused an ImportError when
  the library was located elsewhere in the PYTHONPATH.
- Fixed an issue in the SDK index viewer where the arrows indicating whether a
  query was ascending or descending were not properly rendered.

  URLFetch calls.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2216
- Fixed an issue where you could not schedule a cron job to run every 100
  minutes.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5243
- Fixed an issue in the SDK where failed tasks retried immediately instead of
  waiting for 30 seconds.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5587
- Fixed an issue making it possible to modify request headers using the deferred
  library.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5861

Version 1.5.4
===============================
- You can now specify the maximum size for a blob in create_upload_url().
- Zigzag merge join queries will now continue scanning up to the 30 second
  Datastore query deadline.  For zigzag queries that used to generate NeedIndex
  errors, many will now succeed.  A small percentage will now instead timeout.
- The SDK datastore viewer in the dev console now displays the number of "Write
  Ops" for each entity. "Write Ops" are the total number of entity and index
  writes that were required to create the entity.
- Added API functionality for making calls to the Memcache API asynchronously.
- Fixed an issue that incorrectly allowed creation of tasks with whitespace in
  the url.
- Fixed the error message for "transaction not found" to be more descriptive.

  descending queries correctly.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=3121
- Fixed a typo in the SDK's Datastore Stats generator message.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5425

Version 1.5.3
=============================
- We've removed the limit on the size of blob uploads using the Blobstore API.
- You can now send emails with any attachment extension that is not included on
  the email attachment extension blacklist.
- Added a db.get_indexes() method to retrieve an application's indexes and
  their corresponding states.
- The dev_appserver has been updated to understand the reduced index
  requirements of the 1.5.2 datastore query planner changes.
- The Datastore Admin functionality can now be enabled directly in the Admin
  Console.
- Added cas(), the compare-and-set function, to the Memcache API.
   http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2139
- Added a set_default_fetch_deadline to the URLFetch API which sets the
  URLFetch deadline globally.

  hostname, and service accounts for asserting identity on outbound HTTP calls.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/appidentity/overview.html
- Added an improved HRD migration tool that requires a read-only period relative
  to your datastore write rate (as opposed to your datastore size, which is how
  the current version behaves). The tool is not yet generally available.  If you
  are interested in being an early adopter please fill out this form:
  http://goo.gl/3jrXu
- Fixed an issue in the Channel API where jsapi was not served with the correct
  mime type.
- Fixed an issue that broke use_library when the Python SDK was located in a
  directory that contained the word 'django'.
- Fixed an issue where blobs could not be uploaded using HTTPS.
- Fixed an issue where GQL didn't allow querying for valid kind names
  containing '.', '-', and ':' by supporting quoted identifiers.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2584

Version 1.5.2
=============================
- You can now specify the minimum pending latency for instances and the maximum
  number of idle instances for your application in the Admin Console.
- The datastore now never requires an exploding index.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/queries.html#Big_Entities_and_Exploding_Indexes
- The SDK will now never suggest indexes with the same property repeated, as
  such indexes are likely to be exploding indexes.
- The SDK now supports multiple concurrent transactions.
- Datastore stats are now available on a per-namespace basis.
- The queue details page in the Admin Console now contains request header
  details, previous run information, and a task payload viewer.
- You can modify the lease on a task leased from a pull queue using the
  modify_task_lease() method.
- Pull Task maximum size has been increased to 1MB.
- You can now update the number of available backend instances without needing
  to first stop the backend using the "backend configure" appcfg.py directive.
- You can now set the "References" and "In-Reply-To" headers with the Mail API.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=2802
- The SDK "application" environment variable will now be prefixed with dev~.
  The new preferred way of retrieving your app id is to use
  appidentity.get_application_id(). The --default_partition flag can be used
  for applications whose code relied on a specific environment variable.
- In the Deferred API, defer() now accepts the _target parameter.
- Added a to_dict() function to db.py which converts a model to a dictionary.
- Added a get_original_metadata() method to the Images API to extract EXIF
  information from images.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=4133
- Added an @transactional decorator to db.py for functions that should
  always be run in a transaction.
- Fixed an issue in the SDK where the Deferred API did not work when using
  the --backends flag.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=5072

Version 1.5.1
============================
- ProtoRPC is a new experimental library that provides a simple method for
  creating a well-defined and easy-to-use web-based RPC service.
- The development server's datastore implementation now contains logic that
  closely replicates the consistency guarantees of the High Replication
  datastore. To use, run the dev_appserver with the flag --high_replication set
  to True.
- All user request have an X-AppEngine-Country header which contains the
  ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code for the user, based on the IP address of the
  client request.
- The Channel API can now provide user presence, this can be configured by
  adding channel_presence to the list of inbound services for your application.
- The Images API now supports the WebP format. Due to limitations in PIL, the
  SDK does not support the WebP format.
- You can switch the timezone for App Engine logs in the Admin Console.
  http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=734
- Fixed an issue in the SDK where leased tasks had the POST method. They now
  have a PULL method.
- Fixed an issue where the Channel API didn't work with non-default versions of
  applications using the High Replication datastore.
- When displaying corrupt data in the Admin Console dataviewer, a useful error
  will be displayed, instead of a 500.
  http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=4945

Version 1.5.0
==============================
- Support for Backends which allow developers to create infrastructure
  components that complement the existing dynamic apps that App Engine already
  provides. Instances of a backend can maintain state, be addressed
  individually, and are not subject to per-request time limits. They can also be
  configured to consume more memory and CPU than ordinary dynamic instances.
- Task Queues support pull mode, allowing for more control over task queue work
  rates. To use pull queues, include the 'mode' argument in your queue.yaml.
- Pull queues are supported by a REST API, allowing access from outside App
  Engine. To use the REST API, you must also include a valid ACL section
  specifying which users can lease tasks from the pull queue.
- Task Queue payload limits have been increased. Queues support 100KB per task.
  Within App Engine, the new limit is 32 MB per batch of tasks. With the REST
  API the limit is 1 MB per batch.
- HTTP request and response sizes have been increased to 32 MB.
- We have removed the rate quotas for requests, datastore operations,
  memcache operations, and image API operations. Resource quotas still apply.
- When creating new applications, developers will now see the High Replication
  Datastore as the default configuration option.  Developers that still wish to
  use the Master/Slave configuration must explicitly choose this option at
  application creation time.
- The Task Queue maximum configurable processing rate has been increased to
  500/s.
- We have added two restrictions to the Mail API to improve the reliability
  of the service for all applications.
  - Emails must be sent from email accounts managed by Google (either Gmail or
    a domain signed up for Google Apps).
  - Reduced the number of free recipients per day from 2000 to 100 for new
    applications.
- All application Owners, as listed in the Admin Console, can download the app's
  code, unless code download is disabled for the application.
- Added db.py support for making calls to the datastore asynchronously.
  Available functions are get_async(), put_async(), delete_async(),
  allocate_ids_async(). Call get_result on the return value of asynchronous
  datastore functions to block on the call.
- Metadata queries can now get all namespaces, kinds, and properties in a given
  range.
- The Testbed API now supports the Channel API.
- Users can provide Django settings to be loaded in webapp's django_setup.
- Modified Dashboard latency graphs to indicate they only include dynamic
  requests.
- Fixed an issue where metadata queries did not support unicode characters.
- Fixed an issue where HTTP headers could contain new line characters.
- A warning message is shown when the Python version used to run the SDK is
  different than the Python version used in production.

Version 1.4.1
================================
- During application creation, developers can choose between two Datastore
  configurations: High Replication or Master/Slave.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/hr/#Selecting_a_Datastore
- You can set your application's datastore to read-only mode in the Admin
  Console. Any writes attempted while the app is set to read-only will throw a
  CapabilityDisabledError. This feature can be helpful for migrating or copying
  data between two applications.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/applicationsettings.html#Disable_Datastore_Writes
- The Datastore Admin tool has been updated to allow copying of one app's
  datastore to another. The destination app must have the Remote API enabled.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/adminconsole/datastoreadmin.html

    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=4196

Version 1.4.0
================================
- The Always On feature allows applications to pay and keep 3 instances of their
  application always running, which can significantly reduce application
  latency.
- Developers can now enable Warmup Requests. By specifying  a handler in an
  app's app.yaml, App Engine will attempt to send a Warmup Request to initialize
  new instances before a user interacts with it. This can reduce the latency an
  end-user sees for initializing your application.
- The Channel API is now available for all users.
- Task Queue has been officially released, and is no longer an experimental
  feature. The API import paths that use 'labs' have been deprecated. Task queue
  storage will count towards an application's overall storage quota, and will
  thus be charged for.
- The deadline for Task Queue and Cron requests has been raised to 10 minutes.
  Datastore and API deadlines within those requests remain unchanged.
- For the Task Queue, developers can specify task retry_parameters in their
  queue.yaml.
- Apps that have enabled billing are allowed up to 100 queues with the Task
  Queue API.
- Metadata Queries on the datastore for datastore kinds, namespaces, and entity
  properties are available.
- URLFetch allowed response size has been increased, up to 32 MB. Request size
  is still limited to 1 MB.
- The request and response sizes for the Images API have been increased to
  32 MB.
- The total size of Memcache batch operations is increased to 32 MB. The 1 MB
  limit on individual Memcache objects still applies.
- The attachment size for outgoing emails has been increased from 1 MB to 10 MB.
  The size limit for incoming emails is still 10 MB.
- Size and quantity limits on datastore batch get/put/delete operations have
  been removed. Individual entities are still limited to 1 MB, but your app may
  batch as many entities together for get/put/delete calls as the overall
  datastore deadline will allow for.
- When iterating over query results, the datastore will now asynchronously
  prefetch results, reducing latency in many cases by 10-15%.
- The Admin Console Blacklist page lists the top blacklist rejected visitors.
- The automatic image thumbnailing service supports arbitrary crop sizes up to
  1600px.
- Overall average instance latency in the Admin Console is now a weighted
  average over QPS per instance.
- The developer who uploaded an app version can download that version's code
  using the appcfg.py download_app command. This feature can be disabled on
  a per application basis in the admin console, under the 'Permissions' tab.
  Once disabled, code download for the application CANNOT be re-enabled.
- Fixed an issue where custom Admin Console pages did not work for Google
  Apps for your Domain users.
- In the Python runtime, an instance is killed and restarted when a request
  handler hits DeadlineExceededError. This should fix an issue related to
  intermittent SystemErrors using Django.
    http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=772
- Allow Django initialization to be moved to appengine_config.py to avoid
  Django version conflicts when mixing webapp.template with pure Django.

==================================
- Builtin app.yaml handlers are available for common application functions,
  such as appstats.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/config/appconfig.html#Builtin_Handlers
- The Admin Console now provides an experimental tool to delete all entities in
  the datastore or all entities of a given type. This is available only if
  enabled using the datastore_admin builtin. Deleting entities will count
  against application quota.
    http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/datastore/creatinggettinganddeletingdata.html#Deleting_Entities_in_Bulk
- You can run task queue tasks immediately from the Admin Console.
- You can now specify the quality of JPEG images via the Image API's

- BlobReader now accepts a BlobInfo.
- Removed limits on zigzag merge-join queries. Therefore the error "The built-in
  indices are not efficient enough for this query and your data. Please add a
  composite index for this query." will no longer be thrown in most cases,
  enabling more types of queries without indexes.
- Fixed an issue with task queue tasks not running on the dev_appserver when
  using Python 2.6.
- Fixed an issue on the dev_appserver where auto task running wasn't working for
  BulkAdd.
- Fixed an issue reserving App Ids by owners of similarly-named mails accounts
  containing periods, multiple cases, and googlemail.com address.
